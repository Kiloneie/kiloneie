Github page for all my nimib styled textual versions of my Nim Video Tutorials.

My current list of my Nim tutorial video series:
- Nim for Beginners
- Exploring Nim's Standard Library
- Nim SDL2 Game Development for Beginners
- Metaprogramming in Nim

To Do:
- Make index.html a well index to all my video series and their nimib styled tutorials of my videos, probably using nimib and possibly nimislides
- Get all of the nimib styled tutorials into the respective folders. There are not that many.
- One day maybe... make every single one of my videos to have a nimib styled file...
- Split our nimib tutorials by their sections to fit into nbook

Problems:
- nimib.toml interferes with our find tutorials proc in the "index" file
