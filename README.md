Github page for all my nimib styled offline tutorials of my Nim Tutorial Videos.

My current list of my Nim tutorial video series:
- Nim for Beginners
- Exploring Nim's Standard Library
- Nim SDL2 Game Development for Beginners
- Metaprogramming in Nim

To Do:
- Make index.html a well index to all my video series and their nimib styled tutorials of my videos, probably using nimib, i forgot all my HTML knowledge.
- Check Pietro's page for help on the index.html file
- Get all of the nimib styled tutorials into the respective folders. There are not that many.
- One day maybe... make every single one of my videos to have a nimib styled file...

Don't forget to add videos to the Nim's This month with Nim(all of them to the same commit/issue whatever)
