https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/ For latest version, you must compile yourself(i refuse to do any such extra work that the devs of the project really should of done themselves, and probably did, but didn't share)
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14RPWmR-xOE30aUnZnOy0hT9AzZejNkqs SDL2_gfx.dll 2018 release version

Any and all other libraries that may now be outdated and have newer releases, if they do NOT contain pre-built binaries on official pages, e.g. .dll versions, i will NOT compile. 
That is something the lead dev of that library most probably has already done on atleast his dev platform, and possibly tested on the others, but couldn't be bothered to share...
   If you want me to share the newest version, compile it yourself and send me the file(there are numerous ways to contact me).
ALSO, some of the DLLs used in the video, may no longer be necessary if that functionality is now part of a different SDL2 library, e.g. the main SDL2.dll one.
